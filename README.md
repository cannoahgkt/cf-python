# Exercise 1.1

## Overview
This exercise involved setting up a Python environment, creating a script to add two numbers, installing IPython, and managing dependencies with a requirements file. The steps were documented and the resulting files were organized into this repository.

## Files
- **add.py**: A script that prompts the user to enter two numbers and prints their sum.
- **requirements.txt**: A list of dependencies for this exercise.
- **Screenshots**: Screenshots of each step (with suitable filenames).
- **learning_journal.md** (optional): A document to track your learning progress and goals.

## Steps Completed
1. **Python Environment Setup**:
    - Created a virtual environment named `cf-python-base`.
    - Installed IPython and verified the installation.
    - Generated a `requirements.txt` file.

2. **Script Creation**:
    - Created `add.py` to take user input and add two numbers.
    
3. **New Environment Setup**:
    - Created a new virtual environment named `cf-python-copy`.
    - Installed packages from `requirements.txt` in the new environment.

4. **GitHub Repository Setup**:
    - Created a GitHub repository for the course.
    - Added deliverables to a folder named `Exercise 1.1`.

## Installation and Usage

### Setup the Virtual Environment
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cf-python-course.git
    cd cf-python-course/Exercise 1.1
    ```

2. Create and activate the virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv cf-python-base
    cd cf-python-base/Scripts
    .\activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Script
1. Ensure the virtual environment is activated.
2. Run the `add.py` script:
    ```sh
    python add.py
    ```

## Learning Journal
### Experience
Describe your experience with this exercise.
- Setting up the Python environment was straightforward.
- Creating the `add.py` script helped reinforce my understanding of user input and basic arithmetic operations in Python.

### Goals
- I want to learn more about advanced Python modules and libraries.
- I aim to improve my understanding of version control with Git and GitHub.
