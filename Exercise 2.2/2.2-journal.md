## Achievement 2, Exercise 2.2: Recipe Application with Django

### Task Summary

In this exercise, I recreated my Recipe application using the Django framework. The steps involved setting up the project structure, creating a virtual environment, installing Django, creating a Django project, running the server, and creating a superuser for the admin dashboard.

### Steps and Insights

1. **Create Project Folder and Virtual Environment**
   - I created a folder named `A2_Recipe_App` and navigated into it.
   - Deactivated any existing virtual environment and created a new one named `a2-ve-recipeapp`.
   - Activated the new virtual environment and installed Django.

2. **Create Django Project**
   - Inside the `A2_Recipe_App` folder, I created a Django project named `recipe_project`.

3. **Folder Structure Before Renaming**
   - I took a screenshot of the folder structure before renaming the project directory and saved it as `proj_contents_before_renaming.jpg`.

4. **Rename Project Directory**
   - Renamed the `recipe_project` folder to `src`.
   - Took another screenshot of the folder structure after renaming and saved it as `proj_contents_after_renaming.jpg`.

5. **Run Migrations and Server**
   - Navigated into the `src` folder and ran migrations.
   - Started the Django development server and accessed the success message in the browser.
   - Took a screenshot of the success message and saved it as `server_success.jpg`.

6. **Create Superuser**
   - Created a superuser account for the Django admin.
   - Logged into the admin dashboard, highlighted the superuser, and took a screenshot, saving it as `admin-dashboard.jpg`.
   - Stopped the server by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

### Challenges and Insights

- Setting up the project structure was straightforward, thanks to the clear instructions.
- Renaming the project directory required careful attention to ensure all references were updated correctly.
- Running migrations and starting the server went smoothly, and it was satisfying to see the success message in the browser.
- Creating and logging in with a superuser account in the Django admin was a new experience, and it provided a powerful way to manage the application.

### Screenshots

- `proj_contents_before_renaming.jpg`: Screenshot of the folder structure before renaming the project directory.
- `proj_contents_after_renaming.jpg`: Screenshot of the folder structure after renaming the project directory.
- `server_success.jpg`: Screenshot of the Django server success message.
- `admin-dashboard.jpg`: Screenshot of the Django admin dashboard with the superuser highlighted.

### Next Steps

- Continue developing the Recipe application by adding models, views, and templates.
- Implement functionality for users to input and search for recipes.
- Explore Django's features for handling forms and user authentication.
